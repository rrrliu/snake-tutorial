# Snake Tutorial

Project.ipynb and Python Reference.ipynb are the files to share with students. The first one is the walkthrough of making the Snake game while the second is so that most of their questions about the fundamentals of Python can be answered.

Full Game.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook containing solely code blocks that compose the game, while Project+Solutions.ipynb has sample answers to Project.ipynb that would yield the Full Game by the end.
